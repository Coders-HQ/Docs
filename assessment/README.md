# Assessment

Coders HQ assessment is an initiative that focuses on assessing coders in the UAE with the goal of connecting and matching them to the best opportunities in the market

## How to conduct the tests?

After creating an account you will be sent to a site with multiple skills you can choose from. Each skill assessment has a timer that you need to abide by as you take the test.

## How will the results be used?

*Now*: The results will be supplied to our partners who are looking for developers as a means for them to filter the skills they reuire for the job desceriptions they have.

*Soon*: We will be creating public profiles where the assessment scores will be linked to these profiles. Recruiters will be able to view the profiles and the assessment results and choose the right talent.

## DevSlam

We have our booths at DevSlam where you can come and get assessed for free then have a chat with our partners who are looking for talents to hire.
