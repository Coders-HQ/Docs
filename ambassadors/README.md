# Ambassadors

---

## The first batch of ambassadors have been selected

The recruitment for ambassadors is closed for now and will be open at Q2 2023.

## What is the Ambassador program

The coding ambassadors are representatives of Coders(hq) hand-picked from the Coders(hq) community to facilitate community interactions. The initiative will also help more than 2500 coders to benefit from the program. Ambassadors will have many exciting opportunities to enhance their skills in coding, public speaking, and leading projects. Along with other benefits, ambassadors who achieve exceptional performance will have their efforts showcased on multiple CHQ channels.

The ambassadors will be leading the development of three open source projects. Each of which will be integral in the CHQ roadmap. As well as auxiliary projects, events and workshops.

## Why Projects?

There are multiple ways to learn programming. The three most common ones are:

1. Lectures
2. Workshops
3. Projects

We have seen a lot of lectures and workshops. They are good to give a specific piece of information in a structured manner. However, a lot of the times the projects we undergo are not structured at all and developers prefer to learn by building rather than lectures. This is why we decided the ambassador program will teach development through working on projects, **in addition to the lectures and workshops**, with the community and mentoring them how to use tools like git and CI/CD.

## Objectives

1. Spread knowledge to the coding community by conducting workshops and acting as mentors
2. Co-develop projects with the community
3. Attract people from non-coding backgrounds to the coding community
4. Represent Coders(hq) in public occasions and events

# Ambassador Program Details

## Tiers

There are three tiers for ambassadors (these are selected by looking at the best applicants and then grouping them into a tier system based on their experience and activity)

- 1Ô∏è‚É£  **Silver**: This tier is designed for students in the introductory level in the coding domain
- 2Ô∏è‚É£  **Gold**: This tier is designed for people who have stronger knowledge in the coding field
- 3Ô∏è‚É£  **Platinum**: This tier is dedicated for people who have both coding experience and managerial skills

Every tier will include different **responsibilities** and **benefits**, these are detailed below

### Benefits

(The benefits will be announce once the approvals have been cleared)

### Responsibilities

The responsibility are based on tiers, any member can take any responsibility (additional responsibility will be appreciated and noticed). Although, to keep the management a bit easier, these are the general responsibility of the ambassadors.

| Silver | Gold | Platinum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engage discord community and keep the community up to date with the project progress and events  | Help keep a clear documentation | Make high level decisions on technology and algorithm |
| Develop the open source projects | Maintain the projects quality | Maintain the projects quality |
| Find passionate community members and upskill them | Develop the projects | Identify blocks and come with solutions |
| Work with partners in projects and events | Find passionate community members and upskill them | To manage break down the project and manage the task with the team |
|  | To work with partners in projects and events | To maintain the numbers of the team and to recommend community members as ambassadors for the next batch |
|  |  | To work with partners in projects and events |

With open [source projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-great-about-developing-open-source-and-what-is-not/) comes a lot of responsibility. It is the job of maintainers to make **decisions as a group** on the technology used and the methodology. It is also the job of the team to maintain the codebase and keep the [quality high](https://blog.boot.dev/open-source/contributing-to-open-source/) and not allow for bad commits. [There are huge open source projects](https://blog.containerize.com/2021/09/25/top-5-most-popular-open-source-projects-to-contribute-in-2021/) with hundreds of contributors working together to make complex projects and we aim for these projects to be the same. We would love to have our very own open source projects that you, the ambassadors, will lead with the support of the community to aid in the development.

## Duration

- **6 months** with the opportunity to continue after the time period

We would love if the program lasts for a whole year but we understand that some may not be able to finish the program for various reasons. That is why we will have re-elections where we ask members if they would like to continue and if not we will need to elect new members to fill the space. The re-elections **will also take into account the members activity and engagement throughout the program**.

## Community Engagement

The ambassadors should lead the project but by no means should they do it alone. We have a large **discord community** that the members can tap into and utilize. Ambassadors should use the reach of CHQ to leverage the community into creating these amazing projects.

Part of the members responsibility is to mentor and help onboard any community member who would like to join and build any of the projects. Ambassadors can also attend workshops and make their own lectures. All of this will be facilitated by one member in the ambassador team.

Members who are part of the Coders(hq) community can join and build the projects. Community members who are most active will be voted by the team to receive a certificate. Every team will be able to vote for **3 community members** to get the certificate of achievement.

### Weekly Updates

Every team should have a **bi-weekly update session**. The update session should cover two points

- Update of the **project‚Äôs progress**
- **Onboarding** session for community members who want to participate
    - The onboarding should help upskill new community members by mentoring them to making their first pull request

## Members & Roles

The whole ambassador program will be split into teams that we call units. Every unit will include an a Platinum member as a lead and equal spread of Gold and Silver tiers. Platinum members will lead the decision making while Gold and Silver members will make the project come to life with the support of the discord community.

Every unit should have the following roles assigned (these can be volunteered or voted by the unit)

- **Project Documenter**: Focal point for project documentation. This person should interact with their unit and make sure the documentation of the project is up to standards. They should also talk to the unit and find out why decisions where made and create a page in the documentation of all the major decisions and the reasoning for them.
- **Champion**: The champion is the person who represents the unit and will be the focal point of all the interactions with the external Coders(hq) team. If the team need any advice or help then they should speak with the champion who should interact with CHQ management to make it happen.

### Champion Lead

Champion lead is one member of the program who will be the go to for all things related to the ambassadors program. They will help manage and facilitate all interactions and work closely with every project champion. Big decisions should go through them as they will be in close contact with the CHQ management (as will the champions).

## Communication

The members of the ambassador team will be able to access the ambassador slack channel. Slack will be used as the communication method between the ambassadors.

Ambassadors should also engage the community to find talent and support while creating the projects. This should be done using the dedicated channels within CodersHQ Discord.


# Projects

---

Every member of the ambassador team will be part of a project. There are **three core** projects which will always be worked on by one or more units. These projects will be open source and can be found on GitHub. Platinum members will be able to add gold and silver members to the GitHub teams, merge pull requests and have full access to the repositories.

The three projects are related to CodersHQ‚Äôs general vision to educate, elevate and connect developers within the industry. If built properly they will be a big part of CodersHQ legacy and help a lot of people in their programming journeys. The three projects are:

- **CodersHQ Backend**
- **CodersHQ Interface**
- **CodersHQ Bounty**

Every project should have its own **documentation** too and it is the task of the members of the project to maintain the project‚Äôs docs. These projects will be explained in the later sections.


## Project Description

There are two types of projects, **core projects** and **auxiliary projects**.

Core projects are projects that are relating to CHQ core initiatives and help build its foundation.

Auxiliary projects are usually by our partners which has a real world impact, these will be detailed in GitHub and in slack once we get more information. (2 projects are in the pipeline)

### Requirements

All the projects should have the following features

- Be easy to run tests on (automated tests, CI/CD)
- Easily deployed (think containerization)
- Easy to add and remove features without breaking the whole base (think modular)

### üß†  CodersHQ Backend

CodersHQ has multiple developers with different levels of experiences and a lot of companies working with us. It will be good to be able to capture all of this information in a secure manner.

This project is to create the backend for CodersHQ. The backend should allow connection through API where different applications can access different information within the CodersHQ network depending on the authorization of the user. The backend should connect to a database which has the structure for the following objects*:

- Users
- Profiles
- Events
- Bounties
- Companies

There are a few ways we can do this. The two most common ways are a [REST API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-best-practices-rest-endpoint-design-examples/) and a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) framework. There are differences between [GraphQL and REST](https://www.mobilelive.ca/blog/graphql-vs-rest-what-you-didnt-know) and its up to the team members to use either of these two technologies or something else entirely.

*These are the initial database models. As the projects grows we may need to add more and tune a few things. For now we can start here and improve with time.

### üßë‚Äçüíª CodersHQ Interface

We need an interface with which we can see our developers and create/edit CHQ events.

This project is an interface with the backend in two ways; an admin page (web ui) and a CLI (Command line interface). The interface to the Backend should allow for logging in, editing information, viewing as lists and creating the database objects. 

The design of the interface should be intuitive and modern. Something that would make developers want to use it. It is a good idea to use [references](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiSyOS6z476AhVP_IUKHV4dCXoQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdribbble.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3V4SzkST5IMlBcTGyuDNim) and best practices to creating a modern UI and a [CLI](https://github.com/shadawck/awesome-cli-frameworkshttps://github.com/shadawck/awesome-cli-frameworks). 

### üç´¬†CodersHQ Bounties

Sometimes companies have problems that they don‚Äôt have time to solve or that requires technologies that they are not aware of. This project should allow companies to log in as a company and post their challenge and the reward through a front-end application. It should also connect to the backend‚Äôs company, and bounty objects, and update them after logging in. 

The UI of the Bounties should look modern and have within it all the tools the companies would need to make their bounty clear (rewards, timeframe, etc). The user should also have all the tools they need to hand in their code.

## Project Documentation

Every project should have a document and should be well maintained. Every team should have a member assigned to maintaining the documents quality. The document should have all of the information required for community members to join the project and make pull requests.

## Phase 2

Each of these projects has a phase 2. Meaning that once the project is completed we will move on to building on top of the project using phase 1 as the foundation. Phase 2 will be clarified once the project are completed.

## Certificates

There will be two types of certificates

- **Ambassador completion certificates**: For ambassadors who completed the program
- **High achieving certificates**: For community members who highly achieved (voted by ambassadors). Members receiving this will have a higher probability

The certificates will be awarded at the end of the 6 months.
